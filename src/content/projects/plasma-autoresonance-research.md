## Background

Particle accelerators are used in medical treatments, X-ray generation, and physics research, but traditional designs span kilometers. Plasma-based accelerators could shrink that to meters. My research focused on a key challenge: keeping the laser frequency matched to the plasma wave as it grows, a problem called **autoresonance**.

## What I Did

- Built **numerical models** of a driven pendulum oscillator to simulate autoresonant wave amplitude growth under different drive constants, validating behavior against theoretical predictions.
- Configured and ran **OSIRIS particle-in-cell simulations**, simulating electromagnetic waves propagating into plasma.
- Wrote a **Python data pipeline** using SciPy, NumPy, and matplotlib to process simulation outputs and visualize laser field envelopes and plasma wave dynamics.

**Tools:** OSIRIS (UCLA-developed particle-in-cell simulation framework), Python (SciPy, NumPy, matplotlib)

## Results

**Auto-resonant control of a nonlinear pendulum**

- **Simulated** a driven nonlinear oscillator across four drive strengths to characterize autoresonant behavior.
- **Analyzed** the effects of drive strength and frequency chirping on phase-locking and amplitude growth.
- **Validated** the numerical model by reproducing the expected autoresonance threshold and growth behavior reported in published research.

**Auto-resonant control of PWBA using laser chirping**

- **Modeled** plasma beat-wave dynamics with different chirp rates.
- **Compared** chirped and unchirped wave growth.
- **Validated** sustained amplitude growth under autoresonance.

**Electromagnetic-wave propagation in OSIRIS**

- **Configured** a one-dimensional particle-in-cell simulation with a finite plasma region and launched a localized electromagnetic pulse through the domain.
- **Tracked** the transverse electric field `E_z` alongside plasma density over normalized space and time to visualize the pulse propagating through and beyond the plasma.
- **Tuned** grid resolution and particle count across test scenarios to balance numerical accuracy and signal quality.

## What I Learned

This was my first exposure to a research-grade simulation workflow. I learned how numerical models and large-scale simulations cross-validate each other, and how to extract meaningful signal from noisy raw data.
